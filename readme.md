# Custom Programming Language

This project represents a simple custom programming language designed for educational purposes. The language focuses on clarity and ease of use, eliminating explicit data type declarations and using a minimal, readable syntax.

It supports basic programming constructs such as variables, arithmetic and logical expressions, conditional statements, loops, and user-defined functions, including recursion. The language is intended to demonstrate fundamental concepts of language design and program execution.

## How to Use

1. Modify the test files from the tests folder with your own code.

2. Open the cod+test folder in a terminal.

3. Run the executable file using the command:

```
./proiect
```

## What I Learned

*Designing a simple programming language syntax and structure
*Implementing control flow constructs such as conditionals and loops
*Handling function definitions, parameters, and return values
*Understanding recursion at language level
